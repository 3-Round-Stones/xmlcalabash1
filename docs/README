What is Calabash?

Calabash is an implementation of XProc: An XML Pipeline Language.

This is a very early, alpha release. It passes most of the tests in
the XProc Test Suite but is known to be incomplete.

Prerequisites

Calabash is built with Java 1.5 on top of Saxon. To run it, you'll
need:

    * Java 1.5 or later,
    * Saxon 9.1.0.1 or later
    * Apache HTTP Client (and Apache Commons logging and codec),
      if you want to use p:http-request
    * Saxon-SA, if you want to use p:validate-with-xml-schema
    * XQuery API for Java (XQJ), if you want to use p:xquery
    * Jing if you want to use p:validate-with-relax-ng
    * TagSoup, if you want to be able to parse text/html content
      with the p:unescape-markup step
    * RenderX's XEP, if you want to use the p:xsl-formatter step.
      (You may possibly need the XEP developers kit in addition to XEP.)

(Note: dependency on commercial applications for core XProc steps is a
temporary expediency. Eventually, I'll integrate support for open
source tools like Xerces and FOP. Patches welcome.)

Calabash also implements several extension steps. These are not part
of the XProc core language standard and cannot be expected to reliably
interoperate with other implementations.

    * cx:collection-manager provides a mechanism for associating sets
      of documents with collection() URIs for use in the p:xslt (2.0)
      and p:xquery steps.
    * cx:delta-xml provides an integration with DeltaXML's commercial
      XML-diffing tool suite. Requires the DeltaXML tools, naturally.
    * cx:message is a debugging aid; it's the identity step with a
      message option that will be printed on stderr.
    * cx:nvdl supports NVDL validation of mixed-namespace documents.
    * cx:unzip provides access to the files in a ZIP archive.
    * ml:adhoc-query, ml:invoke-module, and ml:insert-document
      implement Mark Logic Server XCC primitives (incompletely).

How do I use it?

Download the latest release. Inside the archive you'll find calabash.jar.
Make sure that jar file and the prerequisites are on your class path.
Then you can run it from the command line:

  java com.xmlcalabash.drivers.Main options pipeline.xpl

For example:

  java com.xmlcalabash.drivers.Main xpl/pipe.xpl
  <doc xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc">
  Congratulations! You've run your first pipeline!
  </doc>

You can use -iport=file to change the inputs and -oport=file to change
the output location.

For example:

  $ java com.xmlcalabash.drivers.Main -isource=xpl/pipe.xpl -oresult=/tmp/out.xml xpl/pipe.xpl

That will run xpl/pipe.xpl using xpl/pipe.xpl as the input and writing the
result to /tmp/out.xml.

If you run java com.xmlcalabash.drivers.Main with no options, it will
print a short usage summary.
